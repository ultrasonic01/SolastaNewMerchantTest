# SolastaNewMerchantTest
Test mod for Solasta: Test to add Rosary, Greatsword +1, and Longsword +1 to Gorim and Summer's list
You need UMM (Unity Mod Manager) for this mod. Install UMM for Solasta. Then copy all files to ...\Steam\steamapps\common\Slasta_COTM\Mods\SolastaNewMerchantTest\ (You don't need cs files but just in case) 

This is the test mod for early-access version. Any update to this game will break the mod and crash the game.  

You need to start a new campaign for this mod. 

I greatly appreciate the help from Spacehamster and Zappastuff, this mod wouldn't be possible without their help.
